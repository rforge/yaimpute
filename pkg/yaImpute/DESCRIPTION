Description: Performs nearest neighbor-based imputation using one or more alternative 
approaches to processing multivariate data. These include methods based on canonical 
correlation analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and a multivariate adaptation 
of the random forest classification and regression techniques of Leo Breiman and Adele 
Cutler. Additional methods are also offered. The package includes functions for 
comparing the results from running alternative techniques, detecting imputation targets 
that are notably distant from reference observations, detecting and correcting for bias, 
and mapping results.
